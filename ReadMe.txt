Provides C# based framework to define and manage CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) syntax.
css  (Cascading Style Sheets) is a great tool for stylying web pages. But it lacks features of an object-oriented language.
As I moved deep in web development, I realized how important CSS is and how it is equally important to have some sort of easy to use tool to manage my css syntaxes. One major problem I encounterd a lot is: to accomplish something in css one might need to write different versions of the same style syntax to cater for different browsers such as Chrome, FireFox, Opera etc. This is just one problem the other one is: although you have several css editor tools available such as TopStyle, Style Master, Xyle Scope,...(line truncated)...
1. First of all you can design and manage complete style framework within your asp.net project as C# classes.
2. It will offer complete OOP control on your webpage styling. 
3. Re-usability will be the core benifit.
4. You will have an option to either embed style directly to HTML element or you can extract css from the class and save it as a stand alone .css file in your //styles folder to use it in your asp.net project.
5. Designing style templates and using inhertance, overloading and overriding on them, you can achieve much more with less effort.

Altohough some people might want to presume that I may not be faimiliar with what Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) or LESS are designed to do?. Well I know them and Yes I agree they give you certain degree of OOP control on css management, but it is a fact that it takes bit of learning curve to master those and no matter what else I do, I can't get more ease and control of doing something within my .net environment for example c#. So that is it.
Converting complete css grammer to c# will be a challenge and I believe, it will require more than just 2 hands of mine to code it so I am counting for help from all those from my community who find it worth doing.
